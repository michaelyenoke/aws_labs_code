04.You can test that your web server is properly installed and started by entering the public IPv4 address of your EC2 instance in the address bar of a web browser. If your web server is running, then you see the Apache test page. If you don't see the Apache test page, then verify whether you followed the above steps properly and check your inbound rules for the security group that you created.

Make sure the URL Protocol is http not https.

Syntax: http://<Your_Public_IPv4_Address>

Example: http://3.80.149.180
