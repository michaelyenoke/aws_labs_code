After installing apache server, navigate to the html folder where we will put our html page to be published. Use command:

cd /var/www/html/

Create a sample test.html file using nano editor: 

nano test.html

Enter sample HTML content provided below in the file and save the file with Ctrl+X. Click Y to confirm the save, then press Enter to confirm filename.

<HTML>Hi Whizlabs, I am a public page</HTML>

Restart the web server by using the following command: 

systemctl restart httpd

Now enter the file name, i.e., /test.html after the public IPv4 Address which you got when you created the ec2 instance in the browser, and you can see your HTML content.

Make sure URL Protocol is http not https.

Syntax: http://<Your_Public_IPv4_Address>/test.html

Sample URL: 52.90.56.138/test.html
